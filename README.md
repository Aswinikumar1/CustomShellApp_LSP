### 👤 Developed by
Name: Aswini Kumar Jena  
Roll No: 2241010025  
Project: Wipro Capstone Project (Assignment 2 – Linux OS)  

---

### 🎯 Objective
Develop a C++ based custom shell that executes Linux commands, handles redirection, piping, and manages background jobs — replicating core functionality of the Bash shell.

---

### ⚙ Features Implemented
✅ Execute normal Linux commands (ls, pwd, date)  
✅ Input/Output Redirection (>, <)  
✅ Piping (|)  
✅ Background Execution (&)  
✅ Job Control (jobs, fg)  
✅ Built-in commands (cd, exit)  
✅ Signal Handling (ignores Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Z for the shell)

---

### 🧱 Compilation
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp -o AswiniShell
